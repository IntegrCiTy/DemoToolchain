    "# Import networks data to the 3DCityDB\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how the **IntegrCiTy Data Access Layer** (DAL) can be used to import data to the 3DCityDB. \n",
    "In this specific example, **geometric data** (2D line diagram) and of a gas network is **extracted** from separate sources (shapefiles), **consolidated** and **stored** in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extracting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we extract and consolidate data from various files.\n",
    "In this case, all the date is tored in 2 separate shapefiles:\n",
    "* **Gas network pipes**: The positions of all pipes are stored as 2D line diagrams, where each pipe is defined by 2 points (start and end point of a straight pipe).\n",
    "* **Gas network nodes**: Nodes are points in space where either a pipe is connected to a network boundary (substation, building) or where two or more pipes are joined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, both data sets use a consistent set of IDs to refer to pipes and nodes, which makes it possible to easily link the data from both sets.\n",
    "For instance, there is a pipe called *gas_pipe83-224*, whose starting and ending points coincide with *gas_node83* and *gas_node224*, respectively.\n",
    "By checking the data of these nodes, it is possible to see that this pipe is connected to a building on one side (*gas_node83* is connected to *building126*) and that two other pipes are joined to it (*gas_pipe223-224* and *gas_pipe224-225* via *gas_node224*).\n",
    "In real-life applications it might take another pre-processing step to link the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below visualizes part of the network data from the shapefile (with the help of [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/)).\n",

    "<img src=\"./img/network.png\" style=\"height:14cm\">\n",
